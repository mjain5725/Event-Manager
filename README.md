# Event-Manager using Java
The purpose of this project was to find out any overlapping events organized. The events can be organized from any part of the world and the code will change it to local time zone and then will find out the overlapping events.  
If a person try to create wrong event that is he/she tries to make start time greater than the end time or he/she uses differnt time zones for start and end of event then code will throw exception.
